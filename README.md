Hexagonal Golang Microservices with RabbitMQ, Monitoring, and Traefik Routing (Building on Existing User-Auth Services)
This repository extends an existing Golang microservices foundation (likely with user and authentication functionalities) to create a robust and scalable user management system. It adheres to a hexagonal architecture for loose coupling and testability.

Key Features:

Modular Design: Leverages existing user (user) and authentication (auth) services built in Golang.
Asynchronous Communication: Employs RabbitMQ for efficient, message-driven communication between services.
User Service Enhancements:
Queue Creation and Listening: Upon startup, the user service dynamically creates a queue in RabbitMQ to receive data from the auth service.
Data Processing: The user service processes incoming data (likely user registration/login requests) and generates appropriate responses.
Response Delivery: Processed responses are sent back to the auth service using RabbitMQ.
Hexagonal Architecture: Ensures loose coupling and testability of services.
Database Flexibility: Supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL for data persistence, catering to various project requirements.
Comprehensive Monitoring:
Prometheus: Captures application metrics for detailed performance insights.
Grafana: Enables visualization of collected metrics for easier data exploration.
Cadvisor: Provides container-level monitoring within Docker environments.
Streamlined Deployment with Docker Compose: Simplifies service orchestration and ensures consistent deployments.
Shared Routing with Traefik: Implements Traefik as a single instance to manage external traffic routing across services.
Building Upon Existing Services:

This repository assumes the presence of a separate repository containing the user and auth services, potentially with login and user registration functionalities already implemented.

Benefits:

Scalability: The asynchronous communication pattern and containerization facilitate easy scaling of services independently.
Maintainability: Modular design and hexagonal architecture promote code clarity and simpler testing.
Observability: Integrated monitoring tools provide valuable insights into system health and performance.
Efficient Routing: Traefik streamlines external traffic management.
This repository offers a well-structured approach to building a user management system using Golang microservices, RabbitMQ for communication, and Docker for containerization. The integration of monitoring tools and Traefik further enhances observability and routing efficiency.
